* About myself:
    + **I really want to become a programmer and I will do my best for this**
    + I am currently working as an Automation Engineer.
* Unfortunately, I don’t have skills in a programming language yet, but I will develop and acquire them
* code example:
    + function multiply(a, b){
        a * b
      }
    + need to add **return**
    + function multiply(a, b){
        return a * b
      }
* This is my first programming experience.
